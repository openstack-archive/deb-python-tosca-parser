Usage
=====

The TOSCA Parser can be used as a library by any client program, for example,
OpenStack heat-translator uses it to translate TOSCA to Heat Orchestration
Template (HOT).

For an easy reference on how TOSCA Parser can be used programmatically or to
test that the a TOSCA template passes validation, refer to the tosca_parser.py
test program which is located at the root level of the project. Alternatively,
you can install 0.3.0 or higher PyPI release of TOSCA-Parser as available at the
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tosca-parser and test use the parser via CLI
entry point as::
    tosca-parser --template-file=toscaparser/tests/data/tosca_helloworld.yaml
The value to the --template-file is required to be a relative or an absolute path.
